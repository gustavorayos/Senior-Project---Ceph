@webpage{ceph_architecture,
	Abstract = {Ceph uniquely delivers object, block, and file storage in one unified system. Ceph is highly reliable, easy to manage, and free. The power of Ceph can transform your company's IT infrastructure and your ability to manage vast amounts of data. Ceph delivers extraordinary scalability--thousands of clients accessing petabytes to exabytes of data. A Ceph Node leverages commodity hardware and intelligent daemons, and a Ceph Storage Cluster accommodates large numbers of nodes, which communicate with each other to replicate and redistribute data dynamically.},

@webpage{vaughan_linux_future,
	Abstract = {Storage technology has come a long way from the days of, as Linus Torvalds put it, "nasty platters of spinning rust" and Linux has had to keep up. In recent years, for example, flash memory has arrived as enterprise server primary storage and persistent memory is bringing us storage that works at DRAM speeds. At the same time, Big Data, cloud computing, and containers are all bringing new use cases to Linux.
To deal with this, Linux developers are both expanding their existing file and storage programs and working on new ones.},

It is very important to remember that no file system best suits all kinds of applications. Each file system has its particular strengths and weaknesses, which must be taken into account. In addition, even the most sophisticated file system cannot replace a reasonable backup strategy.},
