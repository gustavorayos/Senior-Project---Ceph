# Senior-Project---Ceph

## Background
Conducted further research on Ceph Object Storage Software. Research was a collaborative effort between myself, my mentor at NMSU, New Mexico Consortium, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. 

### About LANL
Los Alamos National Laboratory (Los Alamos or LANL for short) is a United States Department of Energy national laboratory initially organized during World War II for the design of nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan Project, which culminated in the killing of 200,000 Japanese people, mostly civilians. It is located a short distance northwest of Santa Fe, New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Los Alamos was selected as the top secret location for bomb design in late 1942, and officially commissioned the next year, under the management of University of California.
